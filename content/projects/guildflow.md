# Guildflow

[Guildflow](https://guildflow.com/) combines my love of meetup groups with the aspirations of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb). 

Guildflow empowers meetup organizers to create a modern group website that respects the data and privacy rights of its members.

Using Guildflow groups:

* have more control of their data enabling true data portability
* run a website using their own domain
* can offer more fine grained privacy options for its members
