# Guildflow

[Guildflow](https://guildflow.com/) combines my love of meetup groups with the aspirations of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb). 

Guildflow is a new platform that will help group organizers launch websites for their groups; hosted using their **own domain** and allowing them to own their **data** and control their **privacy**.

**Related Tech:** Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, GraphQL, iOS, Android, HTML5, CSS, Multi-tenant Databases.
