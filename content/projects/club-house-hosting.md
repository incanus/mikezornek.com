# Club House Hosting

[Club House Hosting](http://clubhouse.host/) combines my love of meetup groups with the aspirations of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb). 

Club House Hosting is a new platform that will help group organizers launch websites for their groups; hosted using their **own domain** and allowing them to own their **data** and control their **privacy**.

**Launching in early 2020.**

For a sneak peek, check out this tour of a recent internal build:
