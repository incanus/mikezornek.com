I make a living through a combination of personal projects and consulting. 

I am a senior developer who can help you mature team coding practices, design products and improve customer experiences.

I enjoying mentoring and teaching, directly with people one-on-one or through larger teams.

[Let's chat](mailto:zorn@zornlabs.com) and work on something together!

## Services

### Elixir / Phoenix Mentoring and Development

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems.

[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) is a web framework to build rich, interactive web applications quickly, with less code and fewer moving parts. You can use Phoenix to craft APIs, HTML5 apps and more, for fun or at scale. 

I've been working with Elixir and Phoenix since 2017 and find them both enjoyable and productive. In addition to my own [projects](https://guildflow.com), I've helped small startups as well as large consumer facing websites use Elixir and Phoenix to great success.

One of the best roles for me is to join a team and help support full time employees with code review and mentorship while filling in the gaps with dedicated coding work. 

I can also execute and assemble dedicated teams for short term engagements.

### Remote User Testing Sessions

A developer-focused, [Remote User Testing Session](/user-testing/) of your mobile app or website, for $199 

This is a productized-service I started offering in 2020. Since I have a unique skill for identifying user experience issues along with the developer background to address them I can provide a lot of value to a project via a quick testing session. [More info.](/user-testing/)

"Mike and I worked together at STRATIS in 2019/2020 where he helped my team gain momentum on our iOS SDK which is written in Swift.  Mike is an extremely thoughtful and thorough developer, and makes his experience obvious immediately by emphasizing proper unit testing and documentation. The domain at STRATIS is very deep, and often takes newcomers time to completely understand and become productive.  Mike was able to become productive in a very short period of time and was making good suggestions about the project from day one.  I would highly recommend Mike to any team in need of an experienced iOS developer and stellar software engineer."

## Core Values

* I believe in iterative software development.
* I believe it is important to ship software as soon as possible, even though the early versions you'll ship will be miles away from the ultimate vision.
* I believe the most important lessons learned are from the users of your product and the sooner you get the product in their hands the sooner you will know how it needs to evolve to solve their problems.
* I believe in tools that help us get stable solutions to users on a timely basis, including automation, continuous integration, code review and testing.
* I believe for a project to be successful all product owners need to be actively involved.
* I believe in regular user testing and observation, particularly when it comes to mocking up new behaviors before spending time coding up actual solutions.

My rate can vary anywhere in the $125-200/hr range depending on the project complexities and the timelines required. Discounts are available for prepayment.
