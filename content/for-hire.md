I have worked for more than a decade as a self-employed consultant (with a handful of years inside some larger agencies as well). Throughout that time I've helped dozens of companies execute projects on the **Mac, iOS and Web**. I enjoy project variety and the visible personal impact I can make as a consultant. 

[Let's chat](mailto:zorn@zornlabs.com) and work on something together!

## Services

### iOS Development, Mentoring, Teaching

The majority of [my projects](/projects/) in recent history have been in helping companies deliver [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/) apps, through direct development or helping improve their full time iOS employees through teaching and mentorship. I consider myself to have a strong sense of successful user interface and often times help with crafting the user experience as well as implementing actual code behaviors.

### Elixir, Phoenix, Absinthe (GraphQL) Development

I've come to enjoy using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) for personal work and have recently started offering Elixir development as a service. 

> **What is Elixir?** Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems.

I have experience using Elixir to build web apps with [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) as well as [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) endpoints using [Absinthe](https://absinthe-graphql.org/).

### Project Management, Continuous Integration and Delivery

To create a successful development environment requires much more than just good code. On many teams I've helped institute project procedures and other good habits like: better sprint planning, documentation, code review, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and more. If you would like to level up your development team and need a guide, [let's chat](mailto:zorn@zornlabs.com).

## Core Values

* I believe in iterative software development.
* I believe it's important to ship software as soon as possible, even though the early versions you'll ship will be miles away from the ultimate vision.
* I believe the most important lessons learned are from the users of your product and the sooner you get this product in their hands the sooner you will know how it needs to change to solve their problems.
* I believe in tools that help us get stable solutions to user on a timely basis, including automation, continuous integration, code review, testing and sprint planning.
* I believe for a project to be successful all product owners need to be actively involved.
* I believe in regular user testing and observation, particularly when it comes to mocking up new behaviors before spending time coding up actual solutions.
