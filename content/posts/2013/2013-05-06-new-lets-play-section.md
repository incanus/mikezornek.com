While I haven&#8217;t mentioned it too much on the blog, I&#8217;ve recently got back into Let&#8217;s Plays. From the new [Let&#8217;s Play index page][1]:

> Let&#8217;s Plays (often shortened to LPs) are basically people playing a video game and adding commentary on top. Some people like showing off all the things and secrets, such as [HCBaily][2] and [ChuggaaConroy][3], while others treat LPing more as a personal journal, like [NintendoCapriSun][4]. I&#8217;m still finding my voice but am enjoying the process.

I just finished a Let&#8217;s Play of [Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past][5] and have now started a Let&#8217;s Play of [Super Mario Galaxy 2][6].
