title: Do not click on Meetup.com survey links.

Someone has breached Meetup.com security and been sending out links to some sketchy surveys.

![Push Notifications with survey link.][1]

I saw some more yesterday so I figured I&#8217;d post a warning.

Meetup.com seems to be aware of it (as the messages are being deleted) but alas when I asked support I got no response and I see no mention of the security breach on their site.

If you see these, do not click on the links.

UPDATE
