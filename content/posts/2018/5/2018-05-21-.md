I&#8217;m very much looking to move this blog to a static site generator soonâ„¢. That said I&#8217;m picky and not really in love with any of the popular ones out there.

Jekyll would be nice for it&#8217;s large documentation and support but one feature I&#8217;d love to see is the ability to maintain my assets with my articles.

I&#8217;d live to have a folder with all my posts, the folder name would be the slug, the index.md would be the content and I could have images and other resources just live right next to the markdown file. This would let be build images with local references and previewing them with any Markdown renderer. For deployment it would probably be best for the links to be absolute
