From the [App Store Review Guidelines][1]:

> We have over a million Apps in the App Store. If your App doesn&#8217;t do something useful, unique or provide some form of lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted.

I sure wish they would take that guideline to heart and start rejecting some of this shit.

So PBG got an iPad and found some shitty iPad games and I&#8217;d like to say these are the exception &#8212; but they&#8217;re not. There are tons of these crappy apps on the store and while it helps inflate that &#8220;total app&#8221; number for Apple it really hurts people browsing around trying to discover new apps.
