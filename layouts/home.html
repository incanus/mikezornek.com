    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Mike Zornek</strong>. I am a self-employed developer and teacher who focuses on
        building products for the web as well as iOS. I live in Bensalem, PA (just outside of Philadelphia) and you can
        often find me coding and participating in community events at <a href="http://indyhall.org">IndyHall</a>, a
        popular coworking space.</p>

    <p>As far as programming and tech goes, when building custom web sites and services I enjoy using <a

            href="https://phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> and <a href="https://absinthe-graphql.org">Absinthe</a>,
        which powers <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</a> endpoints. I also have a long history of developing for
        the <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Mac and iOS</a>. If you are interested in working with me and want
